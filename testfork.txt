please do not sus me father, for I am not sussable!
One who susses not, is one who must take the shot

A man who susses a baka, forgets no smackah
for a man who susses a baka, must lick the kaka

a removed line...
a stain of history on this paper so blank...
an absence of ink on this crying paper of mine...

but a copy paste shall bring glory back, a simple click and a slick piece of hope...
shall bring my lines back...
